# ICO - Smart-Contracts

An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent of an IPO. A company seeking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service can launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Investors get a certain amount of an ERC-20 in behalf.

## How an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Works

When a cryptocurrency project wants to raise money through an ICO, the project organizers’ first step is determining how they will structure the coin. ICOs can be structured in a few different ways, including:

# Static supply and static price: 

A company can set a specific funding goal or limit, which means that each token sold in the ICO has a preset price, and the total token supply is fixed.

# Static supply and dynamic price: 
An ICO can have a static supply of tokens and a dynamic funding goal—this means that the amount of funds received in the ICO determines the overall price per token.

# Dynamic supply and static price: 
Some ICOs have a dynamic token supply but a static price, meaning that the amount of funding received determines the supply.


These three different types of ICOs are illustrated below:
